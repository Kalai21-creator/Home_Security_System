Home Security System that includes human detection via a PIR motion sensor and an LPG gas leakage detection sensor. This system uses the Arduino controller and is written in Embedded C, with a modular structure that divides the code into .c and .h files. The output will be logged in a text file, and the system will trigger alerts for both human detection and gas leakage.

System Components:
PIR Motion Sensor for human detection
MQ-6 LPG Gas Sensor for gas leakage detection
Buzzer for alerting the user
LED for visual alert
